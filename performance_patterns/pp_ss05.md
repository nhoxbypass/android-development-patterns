# Android Performance Patterns Season 05

## Ep 01: Threading Performance 101

Android redraw the screen every `16.67 ms` to keep the app smoothly at `60 FPS`. If your LameWork is longer, it will cause **dropped frame**. So you must get all of your heavy workload **off** UI (main) thread and communicate back when all of the work are done. Android provide many ways to do so:

* [AsyncTask](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html): Helps get workload on/off main thread the right way. Usually use for simple network operations which do NOT require downloading a lot of data or disk-bound tasks that might take more than a few milliseconds.
* [HandlerThread](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/HandlerThread.html): Dedicated thread for API callbacks to land on. Use for long tasks that requires sequentially communication between the worker thread and the caller thread
* [ThreadPool](https://developer.android.com/training/multiple-threads/run-code.html): Break your workload up into a really small package, and toss them to a bunch of threads. To exploit the powerful multi-core processor and run the tasks concurrently on more than one worker threads.
* [IntentService](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/IntentService.html): Helps get intents work off the UI thread. Use for long scheduled tasks that should run on the background, independent of your activity.

Another thing need to care is memory. Threading and memory never really played well together. It can cause **memory leaks** (using inner class `AsyncTask` then activity get destroyed but `AsyncTask`s & threads are still running and have have reference to this activity,..)


## Ep 02: Understanding Android Threading

* Since thread will **die** when run out of work, so you need to ALWAYS have some sort of **loop running** on the thread.
  
  Eg: [Looper aka Event Loop](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Looper.html) which keep the thread alive and pop tasks/messages off the waiting queue to execute on,..

* In addition, you need some sort of **waiting queue** that the loop can **pull blocks of work** out for execution, and some other **threads that create work** packages and **push them into the queue** for execution.
  
  Eg: [Handler](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler.html) receive tasks/messages from other threads and add to the waiting queue, which give us control to push work at the head/tail or set a time-based delay for blocks of work,..

* And the unit/block of work in Android are explicitly defined as `Intent`s, `Runable`s or `Message`s,.. vary depend on who's issuing them and who's consuming them.

And the combination of all these things together is a `HandlerThread`.
When an app run, the system create for it a process which contain a thread of execution called main thread or UI thread, which is just a `HandlerThread`.


## Ep 03: Memory & Threading

* View can be reference from worker thread to update UI after execute jobs, but this view can be **removed** from the view hierachy **before the jobs done**.

* If an activity is **destroyed** (by calling `finish()` or user rotate the screen or being killed by system,..) but there still exists a threaded block of work that references it, the Activity and entire view-tree will **NOT get collected by GC until that block of work finishes**.
  Eg: If you kick off some work and the user rotates the screen three times in-a-row before that work completes, you could end up with 3 instances of that Activity resident in memory!
  It's NOT just the explicit references to UI objects that you need to worry about but also the implicit references (non-static nested (inner) classes,..).

* Should NOT hold references to any type of UI objects in any of threading scenarios. But how? Use a unique **update function** to update new information for the views **or drop** the work if the view is NOT there anymore.


## Ep 04: Good AsyncTask Hunting

* All `AsyncTask` created will **share the same thread** and thus will [execute in a serial fashion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18661288/android-two-asynctasks-serially-or-parallel-execution-the-second-is-freezing) from a **single message queue**. So if the `AsyncTask` take too long to complete it will **freeze the thread** from doing future work (Unless you use `Executor` with thread pool).
  Eg: If you kick off 20 work orders and the 3rd take an hour -> the other 17 will be blocked and wait!

* To "cancel" some work: First create and check a `isCancelled` flag. Then report work result or drop.

* Non-static nested or **inner class** will create an **implicit references** to the outer enclosing class. So Activity and entire view hierachy that use inner `AsyncTask` (most famous, well-known case) will be **leaked** if it get **destroyed before the AsyncTask work completed**, GC will mark reachable and will NOT swipe the destroyed Activity instance because there is still an implicit reference from `AsyncTask` to it, and `AsyncTask` is **still running**.


## Ep 05: Getting a HandlerThread

* By default, `AsyncTask` execute serially on another thread (already note above), which mean that dealing with an 8Mpxs block of data might stall other `AsyncTask`'s packages that UI thread are waiting for. And this is exactly what `HandlerThread` is for, it effectively a long-running thread that grabs work from a message queue and operates on it, usually when need update multiple UI elements or have repeating tasks.
  Eg: Delegate Camera.open() to HandlerThread, so the preview frames callback will land on the HandlerThread rather than blocking UI or AsyncTask thread.

* When create a `HandlerThread` set thread priority for it based on the type of work is doing. Because CPU can only handle a small number of thread in parallel. By setting priority you help the system know the right ways to schedule jobs. (thread priority is important, explained below).

* Note that `HandlerThread`s run outside of your activityâ€™s lifecycle, so they need to be cleaned up properly or else you will have thread leaks.


## Ep 06: Swimming in Threadpools

* `ThreadPoolExecutor` let you do more customization when using thread to make use of the number of processor available in the devices. It help you spin up a number of threads and toss blocks of work to execute on it, handle all heavy lifting of spinning up the threads, load balancing work across those threads, even killing those threads when they've been idle for a while.

* When creating thread pool, we can specify the number of initial threads and the number of maximum threads as the workload in the thread pool changes it will **scale** the number of alive thread to match.


## Ep 07: The Zen of IntentService

[IntentService](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/IntentService.html) helps get intents work off the UI thread.

* `AsyncTask` does NOT really help when there is no UI. `HandlerThread` while you're NOT receiving intents, the thread is **still sitting around and taking up resources**. But there is another option - `IntentService` - a hybrid between a service and a `HandlerThread` (it extends the `Service` class but internally create and wrap a `HandlerThread` to deal with all coming intents).

* The `HandlerThread` process work from a work queue, it means a task from an intent A which take a long time to complete will block other queued up intents coming to `IntentService`.

* Can use `BroadcastReceiver` to communicate and update UI. But there is a more performant way is use `LocalBroadCastManager` to [report work status](https://developer.android.com/training/run-background-service/report-status.html#ReportStatus) or just use `runOnUiThread()` method after work complete to push a block of work into UI thread handler.

* Use `IntentService` put app into middle of two states "HAS foreground activity" and "NO foreground activity". Help app a little less likely to be killed by the system than just use only `Thread`.


## Ep 08: Threading and Loaders

What do we do with the threaded work when the activity that kicked it off is no longer alive? 

If a thread hold a **strong reference** to the views to update when work complete, BUT the activity end **before the work complete** -> the activity and entire views tree will be keep on memory until that work finished, and this is a memory leak. And even the late updates of the thread to these views are wasted, because they are no longer visible!

Use [Loaders](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/loaders.html)!

* Loaders are wise to the inner working of the activity lifecycle, so you can ensure your work end in the right place everytime! Resistant to memory leaks, always update the correct views and never repeat unnescessarily.

* Instead of kicking off your work on `AsyncTask` or some other threads, ask your activity for instance of a [LoaderManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/LoaderManager.html). Send the work to the manager and it will make sure your work will be handle properly. 

* The `LoaderManager` also cache the work results so that won't be repeated with future changes.

* When an activity with an active loader is popped out of the stack and never return, the `LoaderManager` made a callback saying the result will never be used. Use this callback to abort the work, clean up, and move on without waste anymore resources.


## Ep 09: The Importance of Thread Priority

Spawn too many threads into not enough CPUs is an old problem, thread scheduling has solved this by using various metrics to determine which thread gets the next slice of CPU time. Every thread is assigned a priority, the scheduler will **prefer more** to thread that are more important but **still ballance** with the need to eventually get all it's work done.

Priorities are assigned in a couple of ways.
* Based on the life cycle activity state of your app. Active and visible apps are assigned to the foreground group and will get `90%` of total execution time for the device. So the background group only gets about `10%`.
* When a thread is created by default it's given the **same priority and group memberships** as the "spawner" thread. So if UI thread spawn 20 other worker thread, they will all compete equally for CPU time allocation. -> Explicitly set the priority for any thread that you created in your application.
