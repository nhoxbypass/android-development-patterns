## Categories

### Coding principles

Aim to write code that can be maintained â€” not only by yourself, but by anyone else.

* [SOLID](cates/coding_principle/coding_principle.md#solid)


### Design Patterns

A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.

* [Delegate design pattern](cates/design_patterns/design_patterns.md#delegate-design-pattern)


### Architectural Patterns

An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context.

* [Guide to app architecture](cates/architectural_patterns/architectural_patterns.md#guide-to-app-architecture)

### Android Development Patterns

A series on Best Practices for Android Development. Centered on Android framework APIs, the Support Library, and high level app structure & design. 


### Android Performance Note

Discover surprise knowledge about many aspect of performance in Android apps as well as some micro-optimizations.

* [UI Performance](cates/performance_note/performance_note.md#ui-performance)
* [Execute Speed Performance](cates/performance_note/performance_note.md#execute-speed-performance)
* [Code Optimization](cates/performance_note/performance_note.md#code-optimization)
* [Power Performance](cates/performance_note/performance_note.md#power-performance)


### Android Performance Patterns

A collection of videos focused entirely on helping developers write faster, more performant Android Applications.

* [Season 02](cates/performance_patterns/performance_patterns.md#season-02)
* [Season 03](cates/performance_patterns/performance_patterns.md#season-03)
* [Season 04](cates/performance_patterns/performance_patterns.md#season-04)
* [Season 05](cates/performance_patterns/performance_patterns.md#season-05)

### Android Jetpack

Jetpack is a suite of libraries, tools, and guidance to help developers write high-quality apps easier. These components help you follow best practices, free you from writing boilerplate code, and simplify complex tasks, so you can focus on the code you care about.

* [Android Architecture Components](cates/jetpack/android_jetpack.md#android-architecture-components)


### Testing

Testing your app is an integral part of the app development process. By running tests against your app consistently, you can verify your app's correctness, functional behavior, and usability before you release it publicly.

* [Fundamentals of Testing](cates/testing/testing.md#fundamentals-of-testing)
* [JUnit4 rules with AndroidX Test](cates/testing/testing.md#junit4-rules-with-androidx-test)


### Kotlin notes

Write better Android apps faster with Kotlin - a modern statically typed language - and boost your productivity, increase your developer happiness. 

* [Difference between Kotlin and Java in Android](cates/kotlin/kotlin_note.md#difference-between-kotlin-and-java-in-android)
* [When should use Null in Kotlin](cates/kotlin/kotlin_note.md#when-should-use-null-in-kotlin)
